                            The above picture is clearly not me, but the tagline "insanely curious" does apply.  I like to 
                            learn and have many interests, which has led me to a very unique educational and career path.
                            I started out pre-med on a national merit scholarship, but lost the scholarship the first
                            year due to lack of discipline and no real grown-up skills.  I then joined the navy nuclear
                            program and operated nuclear reactors for 6 years from 1999-2005 similar to Homer Simpson, except
                            on an aircraft carrier (USS Carl Vinson).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After the Navy, I started a construction company in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina with a 
                            few friends, during which time I earned a Residential Homebuilder License.  After about a 
                            year, New Orleans was mainly put back together and I wanted a more steady job with health benefits
                            so I took a job at Samsung Austin Semiconductor as an equipment technician, where I currently 
                            still work.  I chose night shift so I could go to college during the day and pursued a microbiology
                            degree at the University of Texas on a path towards becoming a pharmacist/pharmaceutical researcher.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, during my studies, I transitioned to an engineer role (despite my lack of a degree) and found
                            I enjoyed that much more than microbiology.  I thus completed my degree in microbiology only to then
                            assume the official title of Engineer II at Samsung.  1 year later, I transferred to the IT / Systems
                            department as a software architect and quickly transitioned into management.  Having taken some online
                            computer science classes at Harvard, I was accepted at Georgia Tech for a 
                            master's degree in computer science with a specialization in machine learning, where I am still enrolled.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am now the manager of Software Architecture, UX / UI Design and Full Stack Development and have been in management
                            for roughly 3 years.  Although I love the intense problem solving that comes with 
                            working as an individual contributor, I feel that management, particularly in the field
                            of computer science, is my true calling.  Upon completion of this bootcamp, I will redouble my efforts at Georgia Tech 
                            and hope to graduate in 2022.
